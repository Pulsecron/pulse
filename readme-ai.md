| [tsconfig.eslint.json](tsconfig.eslint.json) | Extends the base TypeScript configuration and includes both source and test directories, allowing JavaScript files inclusion and static type checking during the linting process, to ensure code quality and maintainability in the Pulse project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [package-lock.json](package-lock.json)       | This code file is a vital part of the pulse' repository, an open-source project primarily aimed at schdeuling and executing tasks in JavaScript. The file is designed to support the central functionality of the repository by providing definitions and configurations needed for task scheduling and concurrency management. With respect to the project's architecture, this file is critical for defining the execution flow and protocols according to which tasks are scheduled and executed. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in managing concurrency, thereby ensuring efficient task handling in multi-threaded environments.Under the pulse repository, the examples/concurrency.ts file serves as an example of how to use the main libraries and APIs provided by the repository for task management, while the src directory contains the primary codebase, with index.ts serving as the entry point. In addition, job and pulse directories likely contain different aspects of job scheduling and task management logic. The test directory is used for writing and storing test scripts and ensures the codebase's quality and correctness. Overall, the codebase focuses on ensuring efficient task scheduling, execution, and concurrency management in JavaScript environments. |
| [package.json](package.json)                 | Package.json serves as the pulse project's manifest, outlining key details about the MongoDB-powered scheduling library for Node.js. It lists the project's dependencies, scripts for automated tasks like testing and building, as well as metadata like the author's info, license, and versioning details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json)               | The tsconfig.json provides configuration settings for the TypeScript compiler, specifying general settings like the ECMAScript target version and module resolution strategy.
